## About

``brig`` is a distributed & secure file synchronization tool (and more!)

This is a very early work in progress, so there are no details yet.
More information will follow once a rough first prototype is ready.
For now, you can [read this very chaotic blog](https://disorganizer.github.io/blog/).

## Installation

```bash
$ go get github.com/disorganizer/brig/brig
```

If that complains about some ``ipfs`` dependencies, you might need to follow the ``ipfs`` [install guide](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs#build-from-source).
