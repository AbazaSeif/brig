»brig« is currently developed by [a single guy](https://github.com/sahib) in
his spare time. While he's pretty stubborn, you can probably guess that he
could probably need some help. In it's current state, the software is still far
away from being production ready. This is partly due to missing testing, partly
due to many bugs that are present in the software. Also, the security related
code needs review before serious use in the wild.

<h2>Developing:</h2>

<span class="italic">There are at least three things you can do to help out:</span>

<ul>
<li class="bullet-normal">Report (even better: fix) bug reports.</li>
<li class="bullet-normal">Write down your experience and how the software is currently lacking.</li>
<li class="bullet-normal">Write and improve documentation.</li>
</ul>

Note that we currently will <span class="italic">not</span> accept feature
request, since we first want to pin down the direction of development instead of introducing possible feature creep.

<h2>Donations:</h2>

Working on »brig« full time would be a dream of mine. So, if you'd like to
