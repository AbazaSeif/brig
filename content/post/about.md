»brig« is a free, distributed and quite secure file synchronization program.
It is based on the global peer-to-peer file system [ipfs](https://ipfs.io/).
Think of it as »git« for big files targeted on syncing files.

It tries to focus on being up conceptually simple, by hiding a lot of
complicated details regarding storage and security. Therefore the end result is
(hopefully) easy and pleasant to use, while being secure by default.

Since brig is a »general purpose« tool for file synchronization it of course
cannot excel in all areas. This is especially true for efficiency, which is
sometimes sacrificed to get the balance of usability and security right.
