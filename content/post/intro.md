»brig« is a free, distributred and quite secure file synchronization program.
It is based on the global peer-to-peer filesystem [ipfs](https://ipfs.io/).
Think of it as »git« for big files focused on syn

It tries to focus on being up conceptually simple, by hiding a lot of
complicated details regarding storage and security. Therefore I hope the end
result is easy and pleasant to use, while being to be secure by default.

Since brig is a »general purpose« tool for file synchronization it of course
cannot excel in all areas. This is especially true for efficiency, which is
sometimes sacrificed to get the balance of usability and security right.

**Note:** »brig« is currently in a very early beta phase. Bug reports reports
are appreciated and feature requests are welcome but experience report even
more. Now we have still the chance to change things at will.
