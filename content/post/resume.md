* Encryption of data in rest and transport + compression on the fly.
* Simplified ``git`` version control (no real branches).
* Sync algorithm that can handle moved files and empty directories and files.
* Your data does not need to be stored on the device you are using.
* FUSE filesystem that feels like a normal (sync) folder.
* No central server at all. Still, central architectures can be build with ``brig``.
* Simple user management with users that look like email addresses.
* Hash algorithm can be changed, unlike with ``git``. ;-)
* Works even for nodes that are hidden behind a NAT.
