<ul>
<li>Encryption of data in rest and transport + compression on the fly.</li>
<li>Simplified ``git`` version control (no real branches).</li>
<li>Sync algorithm that can handle moved files and empty directories and files.</li>
<li>Your data does not need to be stored on the device you are using.</li>
<li>FUSE filesystem that feels like a normal (sync) folder.</li>
<li>No central server at all. Still, central architectures can be build with ``brig``</li>.
<li>Simple user management with users that look like email addresses.</li>
<li>Hash algorithm can be changed, unlike with ``git``. ;-)</li>
<li>Works even for nodes that are hidden behind a NAT.</li>
</ul>
