Quickstart
==========

.. todo:: write this (with lots of asciinema)

1. Init
-------

Before you can do anything with ``brig`` you need to create a repository.
During this step, also your online identity will be created. So make sure
to use a sane username (``sahib@wald.de``) and resource (``laptop``).

2. Adding files
---------------

Before synchronizing them, you need to *stage* them. The files will be stored
encrypted (and possibly compressed) in blobs on your harddisks.
