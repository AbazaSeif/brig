How to contribute
=================

.. note::

    Feature request will **NOT BE** considered.
    Read on for the reasoning and details.

This software is still in very early stages and still needs to find the
direction where it's usable for a high number of people. Implementing features
that only a very limited number of users will benefit from is one of the highest
risk currently. Since we also want to make sure that the feature set of »brig«
makes sense as a whole we do not want typical feature request at the moment.

What we want instead are *experience reports*. We want you to use the current state
of the software and write down the following:

- Was it easy to get »brig« running?
- Was it easy to understand it's concepts?
- What is your intented usecase for it? Could you make it work?
- If no, what's missing in your opinion to make the usecase possible?
- Anything else that you feel free to share.

After this we'll try to analyze your reports and create feature requests
acccordingly. Once those were implemented we will probably allow traditional
feature requests to be made.

**What do we want to prevent by this?** Getting 20 feature requests, 5 of them
contradicting each other and. In short: featuritis. It's quite hard to figure
out what users wants from a developers standpoint. So this will hopefully give
us some more insights.

**Are bug reports okay?** Sure. If you already fix the bug it's even better.

**Are very small feature requests okay?** If it's only about changing or
extending an existing feature, it's probably fine. Feel free to create an issue
on GitHub to check back on this before you do any actual changes.
