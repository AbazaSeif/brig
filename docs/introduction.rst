Getting started
================

This guide will walk you through the steps of synchronizing your first files
over ``brig``. It's hand's on, so make sure to open a terminal. We'll explain
all import concepts along the way, so we recommend that you read this from
start to finish.

Creating a repository
---------------------

You need a central place where your files are stored and ``brig`` calls this
place the *repository*. Note that this is not directly comparable to what
other tools calls the *Sync folder*. Rather think of it as the ``.git`` folder
of a ``git``-repository: A place where all internal state, data and metadata
of ``brig`` is stored.

By creating a new repository you also generate your identity, under which
your buddies can later find *and* authenticate you.

But enough of the grey theory, let's get started:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mkdir ~/metadata && cd ~/metadata
    $ brig init donald@whitehouse.gov/ovaloffice
    27.12.2017/14:44:39 ⚐ Starting daemon from: /home/sahib/go/bin/brig

         \  \:\/:/     \  \:\          /__/:/    \  \:\/:/
          \  \::/       \  \:\         \__\/      \  \::/
           \__\/         \__\/                     \__\/


         A new file README.md was automatically added.
         Use 'brig cat README.md' to view it & get started.
    $ ls
    config.yml  data  gpg.prv  gpg.pub  logs  metadata
    meta.yml  passwd.locked  remotes.yml

The name you specified after the ``init`` is the name that will be shown
to other users and by which you are searchable in the network.
See :ref:`about_names` for more details on the subject.

You will be asked to enter a new password. *»Why«* you ask? This password is
used to store your data in an encrypted manner on your harddisk. This is
especially important if you think about creating the repository on a portable
media (e.g. usb sticks). If you still choose to disable this security feature
you're free to do so by passing ``-x`` directly before the ``init`` subcommand.

Also note that a lot of files were created in the current directory.
This is all part of the metadata that is being used by the daemon that runs
in the background.

Adding & Viewing files
----------------------

Phew, that was a lot of text, but there was not any real action yet.
Let's change that by adding some files to ``brig``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ echo "Hello World" > /tmp/hello.world
    $ brig stage /tmp/hello.world
    $ brig cat hello.world
    Hello World
    $ brig ls
    SIZE   MODTIME          PATH          PIN
    443 B  Dec 27 14:44:44  /README.md     🖈
    12 B   Dec 27 15:14:16  /hello.world   🖈 

You might have noticed that the »hello.world« file was stored in ``brig`` without the
full path (»/tmp/hello.world«). This is done on purpose, since you should imagine all
added files live under an own root. You can however give the file a new name while adding it:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ brig stage /tmp/hello.world /hallo.welt

Mounting repositories
---------------------

There are subcommands that act very similar to ``mkdir``, ``rm`` and ``mv``.
While those surely are useful, it's not a very native feel of handling files.
That's why you can mount all files kown to ``brig`` to a special folder:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ mkdir ~/data && cd ~/data
   $ brig mount ~/data
   $ cat hello-world
   Hello World


You can use this directory (almost) exactly like a normal one.
We recommend though, that you shouldn't do any heavy editing inside of the folder
and use it more like a »transfer box« for efficiency reasons.

Remotes
-------

Until now, all files where only local. How do we even talk to other peers? This
is done by adding them as »remote«. Every repository you are using has
a user-chosen name (»donald@whitehoure.gov/ovaloffice«) and a unique
fingerprint that was generated during ``init``. Let's see what our own fingerprint is:


.. code-block:: bash

    # The hash will most likely look different for you:
    $ brig whoami
    donald@whitehouse.gov/ovaloffice QmTTJbkfG267gidFKfDTV4j1c843z4tkUG93Hw8r6kZ17a:SEfXUDvKzjRPb4rbbkKqwfcs1eLkMwUpw4C35TJ9mdtWnUHJaeKQYxjFnu7nzrWgU3XXHoW6AjvBv5FcwyJjSMHu4VR4f

The fingerprint consists of two hashes divided by a colon (:). The first part
is the identity of your ``ipfs`` node, the second part is the fingerprint of a
keypair that was generated by ``brig`` and will be used to authenticate other
peers.

Now let's assume another user (let's call him Vladimir) wants to synchronize files with Donald.
Both sides now need to share the information printed by ``brig whoami`` over a secure side channel.
This side channel could be one of the following:

- Encrpyted mail.
- A secure instant messenger of your choice.
- Any insecure channel, as long you call or meet the person later and you validate at least a few digits of his fingerprint.

Once you have exchanged the fingerprints, both sides can add each other:

.. code-block:: bash

	brig remote add vladimir \
		QmUDSXt27LbCCG7NfNXfnwUkqwCig8RzV1wzB9ekdXaag7:
		SEfXUDSXt27LbCCG7NfNXfnwUkqwCig8RzV1wzB9ekdXaag7wEghtP787DUvDMyYucLGugHMZMnRZBAa4qQFLugyoDhEW

After doing so ``brig`` can figure out the rest (i.e. how to actually reach the node over the network itself).
Remember that this mechanism might seem inconvinient at first, but it's the only way for you to actually check
if someone is truly the person he claims to be.

.. note::

	Later we might make this easier by interpreting the username as an email and/or encoding the fingerprint as QR-code.

If both sides are up & running, we can check if we can reach the other side:

	$ brig net list
	TODO: output
	# Yep that works.
	$ brig remote ping vladimir
	TODO: output
	# Cool, we really can reach them.

.. note:: About open ports:

   While ``ipfs`` tries to do it's best to avoid having the user to open ports in his firewall/router.
   This mechanism might not be perfect though (and maybe never is). If any of the following network
   operations might not work it might be necessary to open the ports 4001 - 4005 or to enable
   UPnP. This only is necessary if the computers you're using ``brig`` on are not in the same network.

This all requires of course that both partners are online at the same time.
Later versions might make it possible to have a third party instance that acts
as intermediate cache. This would then resemble something like ``ownCloud`` does.

.. _about_names:

About names
~~~~~~~~~~~

What are those names actually for?

TODO: write this section (mention jabber id)

Since ``brig`` is built on-top of ``ipfs``, all users can find each other
and sync files among them. The name is used as a human readable token
to (hopefully) uniquely identify a single user.

.. note::

    ``brig`` does not use the name to authenticate a user. This is done
    by the *fingerprint*, which is explained later. Think of the name
    as a »DNS«-name for fingerprints.

Names can be used to locate other users:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ brig locate alice@wonderland.org

Syncing
-------

Finally there. Let's recap what we've done so far:

- Create a repository (``brig init <name>``) - needs to be done only once.
- Find & add remotes (``brig remote add``) - needs to be done once for each peer.
- Add some files (``brig stage <path>``) - needs to be done as much as you like to.

Only thing left to do now is using ``brig sync``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ brig diff vladimir
    # TODO: Provide output.
    $ brig sync vladimir
    $ brig ls
    SIZE   MODTIME          PATH          PIN
    443 B  Dec 27 14:44:44  /README.md     🖈
    12 B   Dec 27 15:14:16  /hello.world   🖈
	32 GB  Dec 27 15:14:16  /election      🖈

You might notice that the ``sync`` step was kind of fast for 32 GB. This is
because ``sync`` *does not transfer actual data*. It only transferred the
metadata, while the actual ``data`` will only be loaded when required. This
also means that your data does not need to reside on the same device on which
you are using ``brig``. You could have one instance on your always online
server, while you use only tiny parts of it on your small netbook.

Where is the data then? Thanks to ``ipfs`` it can be transferred from anywhere,
but usually nodes that already downloaded the file from the origin. This is
another advantage of a distributed approach: The original node does not need to
be online as long as some other node also has your file stored. Note that your
node will not pro-actively gather data you won't use. It simply might cache
data longer than necessary.

How are the files secure then if they essentially could be everywhere?
Every file is encrypted by ``brig`` before giving it to ``ipfs``. The key is part
of the metadata and will be used to decrypt the file again on the receiver's end.

How do we control then what files are stored locally and what not? By *pinning*
each file or directory you want to keep always. Files you add explicitly are
pinned by default and also files that were synced to you. Only old versions of
a file are by default unpinned. If you want to clean up data (i.e. files are not pinned)
you can invoke ``brig gc``.
