Other commands
--------------

.. todo:: This section is silly.

There are a few other commands, but they are not (yet) very useful for most end
users. Therefore they will not be explained in depth to save you some mental
space. The commands in question are:

- ``brig become``: View the metadata of another remote. Good for debugging.
- ``brig daemon``: Start the daemon manually. Good for init systems like ``systemd``.
- ``brig net``: Commands to modify the network status and find other peers.
- ``brig edit``: Edit a file in brig with the ``$EDITOR``. Good for quick edits.
- ``brig fetch``: Manually trigger the fetching of a remote's metadata. Also good for debugging.

Please use ``brig help <command>`` to find out more about them if you're interested.

.. [#] ``brig rm`` for example deletes directories without needing a ``-r`` switch.
