General questions
-----------------

1. Why is the software named ``brig``?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is named after the ship with the same name.
When we named it, we thought it's a good name for the following reason:

- A ``brig`` is a very lightweight and fast ship.
- It was commonly used to transport small amount of goods.
- A ship operates on streams (sorry :)
- The name is short and is not very far from ``git``.
- It gives you a few nautical metaphors and a logo for free.

Truth be told, only half of the two name givers thought it's a good name, but
I still kinda like it.

2. Who develops it?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although this documentation speaks of »we«, the only developer is currently
[Chris Pahl](https://github.com/sahib). He writes it entirely in his free time
(and ther emostly during commuting with the train).
