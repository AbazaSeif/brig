Here's a small checklist before publishing your pull request:

* Did you ``go fmt`` all code?
* Does your code style fit with the rest of the code base?
* Did you run ``make lint``?
* Did you write tests if necessary?
* Did you consider if changes to the docs are necessary?
* Did you check if you need something to CHANGELOG.md?


Thank you for your contribution.
