- High CPU consumption when pinging others. (Havoc'd go routine?)
- Check backend to be safe to run from multiple go routines
- `brig locate` is not working.
- brig config swarmport is not used?
- gometalinting / cleaning up
- sync algorithm is not fully fledged out
- add more tests where appropiate (sync...)
- design sh test suite / tui tests / situation preps.
- see if we can disable ipfs gateway & api port.


=================

brig history:

- Multiple moves in staging do not go well.
- Old deleted/moved files can be still reached (is that good or bad?)
- Intermediate move ghost show weird/incorrect things.
