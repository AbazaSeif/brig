- writing logs does not seem to work currently.
- High CPU consumption when pinging others. (Havoc'd go routine?)
- Check backend to be safe to run from multiple go routines
- brig config swarmport is not used?
- gometalinting / cleaning up
- add more tests where appropiate (sync...)
- design sh test suite / tui tests / situation preps.


- Pinning looks somewhat broken when e.g. moving directories.
