- writing logs does not seem to work currently.
- Check backend to be safe to run from multiple go routines
- brig config swarmport is not used?
- gometalinting / cleaning up
- add more tests where appropiate (sync...)
- design sh test suite / tui tests / situation preps.

- Pinning looks somewhat broken when e.g. moving directories.
- brig mv leaves dead-ghost traces when moving between directories. (unconfirmed)
- brig reset: says "not pinned" when checking out old commits (well...)
