Config Values
=============

Similar to ``git`` there is a global configuration, where also all
repositories on the device is stored.

- Node Type: [archive, backup, desktop, checkout, hold]

    - archive  => revision control to certain depth, autosync to archive.
    - backup   => revision control with depth of 1.
    - client   => No revision control [default]
    - checkout => No autosync, only checkout certain files
    - hold     => Hold repository that removes file after certain time.

- Merge Priorities

    - Give certain peers a priority. In case of merge conflicts highest ranking
      will be kept.
    - Repositories with same bare jabber id get higher priority by default.
    - Maybe introduce a merge bin with files that need manual review?
