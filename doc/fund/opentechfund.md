# Basic Idea

The basic idea is to build/develop a dezentralized toolset for file exchange
as an alternative to the widely used centralized cloud ecosystem. File and
information exchange nowadays is largely based on centralized Cloud-Serivces. 

Using a centralized, company controlled infrastructure there are some 
obvious risks like:

    * privacy issues, access by third party
    * data loss

    * restrictive Internet filtering by technical methods (IP blocking, DNS filtering, TCP RST, DPI, etc.)
    * Blocking, filtering, or modification of political, social, and/or religious content (including apps)
    * Technical attacks against government critics, journalists, and/or human rights organizations (Cyberattacks)
    * Government practices that hold intermediaries (social networks or ISPs) liable for user content
    * Physical intimidation, arrest, violence (including device seizure or destruction), and death for political or social reasons Prohibitive cost to access the Internet
    * Pro-government manipulation of online discussions (propaganda, imitation content, and/or sockpuppets)
    * Policies, laws, or directives that increase surveillance, censorship, and punishment
    * Repressive surveillance or monitoring of communication
    * Localized or nationwide communications shut down or throttling (Blackouts)

Another problem is, that most of the software used to share data - by using a
cloud service - is closed source nowadays. So application may have backdoors, to
manipulate data.

# What are hoped for goals or longer term effects of the project?

The goal is to create a software and infrastructure that is as importent as the tor
projekt to protect human rights nowadays.

# How you will do it?

* Development of a alpha prototype which works as a proof of concept at the end of the master thesis
* Research on fundamental security and data distribution concepts by the end of the master thesis
* Development and improvement of secrutiy and network routing related aspects of the project
* Building a first prototype that might be used by non technical people
* Research on security and dezentralized networks
* Development of a user focused
